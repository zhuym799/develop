3.	Registration Data.  We use Registration Data to tailor our site to your particular needs.  We also use Registration Data to send you information about our company and service and to keep you informed of enhancements and complementary products in which you might be interested.  We use demographic and profile information to tailor your experience at our site, showing you the content that we think you might be interested in as well as displaying the content according to your preferences.  You may choose to stop receiving future communications from us.  Please see the Opt-Out and Discontinue Section below.  

4.	Cookies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  If you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies.  However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a web site if you do so.  We use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests.  Advertisers that display ads on our site may also use cookies.  Indigorose.com does not have access to the information obtained from those cookies. 

5.	IP Addresses.  IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data known as "traffic data" so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.  Indigorose.com will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information. 

6.	Referers.  A Referer is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server as "traffic data".  This information is used by Indigorose.com to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests.  You will not be personally identified from this information. 

7.	System Information.  System information we collect as part of "traffic data" includes time, the type of web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed.  This information is sent automatically by your web browser when you are connected to a web site. This information is used by Indigorose.com in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system.  You will not be personally identified from this information. 

8.	Sharing of Information.  Indigorose.com feels strongly that your personal data should only be seen by you, unless you choose to share it with others.  We will never sell, rent, license or exchange personally identifiable data with a third party without your permission.  No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission.  Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as a part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, Indigorose.com will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if Indigorose.com is required to do so by law, or (ii) if Indigorose.com has the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on Indigorose.com, or to protect and defend the rights or property of Indigorose.com or another subscriber or to enforce the Terms of Use. 

9.	Other Web Sites, Links, And Advertisers.  This web site contains links to other web sites.  Indigorose.com advertisers may also have links on this web site.  The privacy practices of those advertisers or web sites linked to Indigorose.com are not covered by this privacy statement and Indigorose.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites.   Additionally, if you make a purchase from a store or merchant listed on or linked to the Indigorose.com web site, any information that you give, such as your credit card number and contact information, is provided to those merchants.  These merchants have separate privacy and data collection practices and Indigorose.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies.
